## Frequently asked questions

> It tells me i should have received X legendaries but i actually have Y!

  Even though we try to correlate legendary drops to content done, it's still all based on **RNG**. Some people are lucky, and some are not.

> My alt has way to much killpoints.

  A part of the killpoints calculation is based on the time that character has been level 110. Please set character specific achievements ingame under `Interface > Social`, or else a part of the killpoints will be based on how long *your main* has been 110.

> My killpoints aren't showing, i keep seeing the spinner.
